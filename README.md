A command line tool that paints images (or text) onto audio spectograms. You can later merge those with existing sound files to create ARGs, [video game easter eggs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yzFit0nldf4) or transmit them to your favorite [globular cluster](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arecibo_message).

Duration and frequency ranges are adjustable.
